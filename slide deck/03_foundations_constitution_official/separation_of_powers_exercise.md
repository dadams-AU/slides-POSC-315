### Interactive Exercise - Separation of Powers ðŸŽ­

#### **Activity Overview:**
Students will be divided into three groups, each representing one of the branches of the U.S. government: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. Each group will be given a policy scenario and will need to explain their branch's role in the policymaking process for that scenario. After group discussions, there will be a debrief session to discuss how the separation of powers influences policy development and implementation.

#### **Instructions:**
1. **Divide the Class into Three Groups**:
   - **Group 1**: **Legislative Branch** (Congress)
   - **Group 2**: **Executive Branch** (President and Federal Agencies)
   - **Group 3**: **Judicial Branch** (Federal Courts, including the Supreme Court)

2. **Assign a Scenario to Each Group**:
   - Each group will work on the same scenario but from the perspective of their assigned branch.

3. **Group Tasks**:
   - **Legislative Group**: Discuss how Congress would initiate, debate, and pass legislation related to the scenario. Consider the role of committees, the House and Senate, and how lobbying or public opinion might influence the process.
   - **Executive Group**: Explore how the President and federal agencies would implement and enforce the policy. Consider executive orders, regulations, and the role of the bureaucracy in shaping the policy's outcomes.
   - **Judicial Group**: Analyze how the courts might be involved in interpreting the policy, resolving disputes, or challenging the constitutionality of the law. Consider the process of judicial review and potential lawsuits.

4. **Scenarios**:

   **Scenario 1: Environmental Law - Clean Air Act Amendments**
   - **Background**: Congress is considering amendments to the Clean Air Act to impose stricter emissions standards on automobiles to reduce air pollution.
   - **Legislative Group**: Discuss how the bill would be introduced, debated, and potentially amended in Congress. What role do special interest groups and environmental organizations play?
   - **Executive Group**: Consider how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would implement these new standards. What challenges might the President face in enforcing the amendments?
   - **Judicial Group**: Analyze potential legal challenges from automobile manufacturers or states with heavy industrial sectors. How might the courts assess the balance between environmental protection and economic impact?

   **Scenario 2: Healthcare Policy - Medicare Expansion**
   - **Background**: A new proposal aims to expand Medicare to cover more people, including those aged 60 and above, instead of the current 65+.
   - **Legislative Group**: Discuss the legislative process for expanding Medicare. What are the potential hurdles in passing the bill through Congress? How might different political ideologies affect the debate?
   - **Executive Group**: Consider how the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would manage the expansion. What role would the President play in promoting or opposing the expansion?
   - **Judicial Group**: Explore possible legal challenges from private insurance companies or states that disagree with the expansion. How could the courts influence the final outcome of the policy?

   **Scenario 3: Immigration Reform - Pathway to Citizenship**
   - **Background**: A proposed law aims to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet certain criteria, such as having lived in the U.S. for more than 10 years and having no criminal record.
   - **Legislative Group**: Discuss the process of drafting, debating, and voting on this legislation. What compromises might be necessary to gain bipartisan support?
   - **Executive Group**: Examine how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) would implement the pathway to citizenship. What challenges might arise in enforcement?
   - **Judicial Group**: Consider potential legal challenges, such as disputes over the eligibility criteria or the constitutionality of the pathway to citizenship. How might these challenges be resolved in the courts?

5. **Debrief**:
   - After the group discussions, bring the class back together for a debrief session.
   - **Questions for Discussion**:
     - How did each branch's role affect the development and implementation of the policy?
     - What challenges did each branch face in fulfilling its role?
     - How does the separation of powers help or hinder effective policymaking?
     - In what ways do the branches collaborate, and where do they come into conflict?
     - Reflect on a real-world example where the separation of powers significantly impacted a policy outcome.

6. **Wrap-Up**:
   - Summarize the key insights from the exercise.
   - Highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between the branches of government in the policy process.
   - Connect the exercise to the broader themes of the course, emphasizing how separation of powers shapes public policy in the United States.
