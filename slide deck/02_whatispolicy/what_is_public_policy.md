# What is Public Policy?

**Public Policy** is what officials within government, and by extension the citizens they represent, choose to do or not to do about public problems.

**There's no single definition of public policy.** It's a complex and multifaceted concept that can be understood in many ways.

# Defining the Field(s) of Policy Studies

- **Policy studies** is an interdisciplinary field that examines both the content and process of public policies.
- Smith and Larimer emphasize that it encompasses multiple subfields:
  - **Policy Analysis:** Evaluates policy outcomes and alternatives.
  - **Policy Process:** Studies how policies are formulated and implemented.
  - **Policy Advocacy and Governance:** Examines the influence of interest groups and governance structures.
- These subfields are interconnected, reflecting the complexity of real-world policy challenges.

# Many different ways to discuss public policy

1. **Intentions**: the purposes of government action
2. **Goals**: the stated ends to be achieved
3. **Plans or proposals**: the means to achieve the goals
4. **Programs**: the authorized means for pursuing the goals
5. **Decisions or choices**: specific actions that are taken to set goals, develop plans, and implement programs

# Policy Outputs and Outcomes

1. **Policy Outputs**: the formal actions that governments take to pursue their goals
2. **Policy Outcomes**: the effects that result from policy outputs
